## About VIbe

VIbe is the flagship platform built by **Volunteers Incorporated** -- a volunteer engagement and social giving platform that connects nonprofit organizations, community groups, and social enterprises with passionate volunteers and donors across Jamaica and beyond.

Available on **iPhone, Android, and the web**, VIbe gives your organization a modern, all-in-one digital home for recruiting volunteers, managing events, running fundraising campaigns, and tracking real community impact -- all from a single platform.

## What Is a VIbe Partner Organization?

A VIbe Partner Organization is a verified nonprofit, community group, charity, or social enterprise that has been approved to use the platform to post volunteer opportunities, host events, launch fundraising causes, and directly engage with the VIbe community of active volunteers and donors.

Partner organizations receive a **Golden Verification Badge** that appears on their profile and throughout the platform, signalling to the community that they are a trusted, vetted organization.

## What Does My Organization Get Access To?

Once activated, your organization unlocks a powerful suite of tools designed to help you recruit volunteers, engage the community, and grow your impact.

### 1. Post Volunteer Opportunities

Create and publish volunteer opportunities directly to the VIbe community. Each opportunity listing includes:

- A clear title and detailed description of the role
- The category of work (e.g., education, environment, healthcare)
- Location details with an interactive map
- Available dates and times
- The number of volunteer spots available
- Required skills
- An impact statement explaining why this opportunity matters
- Photos to bring the opportunity to life
- Contact details for on-the-ground coordination

Volunteers in the community can discover your opportunities through the app's search and explore features, sign up instantly, and show up ready to help.

### 2. QR Code Check-In System

Every opportunity comes with a built-in **QR Code check-in system**. When volunteers arrive at your event or activity, they simply scan the QR code to confirm their attendance. This gives you:

- Accurate, real-time attendance tracking
- Automatic logging of volunteer hours
- A verifiable record of participation for reporting and compliance
- No more paper sign-in sheets or manual hour tracking

### 3. Host and Manage Events

Go beyond individual opportunities and host full community events. VIbe's event management tools allow you to:

- Create events with detailed descriptions, dates, and locations
- Manage event registrations
- Coordinate logistics through the platform
- Build a calendar of activities for your organization

### 4. Launch Fundraising Causes

Need to raise funds for a project, initiative, or emergency response? VIbe lets you create **Fundraising Causes** where the community can contribute directly. Features include:

- Set a fundraising goal and track progress in real time
- Accept one-time donations from supporters
- Enable recurring donations (monthly, quarterly, or annually) for sustained support
- Share your cause across the platform and beyond

### 5. Connect and Communicate with Volunteers

VIbe includes a built-in **messaging system** so your organization can communicate directly with volunteers. Whether you need to send updates before an event, coordinate logistics, or simply say thank you -- it is all within the app.

### 6. Verified Public Profile

Your organization receives a **dedicated public profile page** on VIbe that showcases:

- Your organization's name, description, and mission
- Your areas of focus and industry tags
- Your website and contact information
- Your Golden Verification Badge
- A history of your opportunities and events

This profile acts as your organization's digital storefront on the platform, helping you attract new volunteers and donors.

### 7. Shoutouts and Community Recognition

Celebrate your volunteers with the **Shoutouts** feature. Publicly recognize individuals who have gone above and beyond, building goodwill and encouraging continued engagement from the community.

### 8. Volunteer Hour Tracking and Impact Reporting

Every check-in, every hour, and every completed opportunity is automatically tracked. This gives your organization access to:

- Total volunteer hours contributed to your opportunities
- Attendance records for each event or activity
- Data you can use in grant applications, annual reports, and impact assessments

### 9. Push Notifications and Reminders

Keep your volunteers informed and engaged with automatic push notifications. Volunteers who sign up for your opportunities receive reminders about upcoming activities, and your organization can stay top-of-mind in the community.

## Why Partner with VIbe?

### Reach More Volunteers, Faster

VIbe gives your organization access to a growing community of individuals who are actively looking for ways to give back. Instead of posting on social media and hoping the right people see it, you are putting your opportunities directly in front of people who want to help.

### Save Time on Administration

The QR code check-in system, automatic hour tracking, and digital registration eliminate hours of manual paperwork. Your team spends less time on administration and more time on the mission.

### Build Trust with Verification

The Golden Verification Badge tells the community that your organization has been reviewed and approved by VIbe. This builds immediate trust with potential volunteers and donors who may not yet know your organization.

### All-in-One Platform

Instead of juggling multiple tools for volunteer recruitment, event management, fundraising, and communications, VIbe brings everything together in one place. One login, one dashboard, one platform.

### Track and Prove Your Impact

With automatic tracking of volunteer hours, attendance, and donations, your organization always has up-to-date data to include in grant applications, board reports, and impact assessments. No more estimating -- you have the real numbers.

### Engage Donors and Volunteers Together

VIbe is unique in that it combines volunteering and giving on one platform. A volunteer who helps at your event today might become a donor to your cause tomorrow. The platform nurtures that journey naturally.

### Mobile-First and Accessible

VIbe is designed for the way people use technology today -- on their phones. Volunteers can discover, sign up for, and check in to opportunities all from their mobile device. Your organization is always just a tap away.

### Grow Your Organization's Visibility

Every opportunity you post, every event you host, and every cause you launch increases your organization's visibility on the platform. The more active you are, the more the community sees and engages with your work.
